## Part I. Abstract Model

Subjects tested:
  * OO Concepts
  * MySQL
  * CRUD
  * Object-relational mapping

In this folder you will find
  * `Contact.php` - Class to be used for testing
  * `contacts.sql` - Test data
  * `contact_test.php` - Unit tests

There is a class in `Contact.php` that extends an abstract class called `AbstractModel`. You will need to build this abstract class.

To develop `AbstractModel`, you will need to:
* Import `contacts.sql` into a MySQL database
* Write `AbstractModel.php`
* Confirm `contacts_test.php` runs correctly.

* REQUIRED METHODS
  * `public function save()`
  * `public function load($id)`
  * `public function delete($id=false)`
  * `public function getData($key=false)`
  * `public function setData($arr, $value=false)`
  
You will need to make database calls in these methods. Please use the PHP MySQL adapter of your choice.

**NOTE**: You do not need to make `AbstractModel` work with composite keys. Assume all models extending from this table use a single primary key.

## Part II. Framework

Subjects tested:
* MVC
* Framework Exposure

Using the framework of your choice, incorporate the abstract model into a simple application.

Application guidelines:
* Must have a URL where a contact's information is visibleâ€”something like example.com/contact/view?id=[some_id]
* Must use the Contact model shown above to load the record.
