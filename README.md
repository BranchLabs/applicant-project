## About the solution

Project is crafted as a WP Plugin. Just copy the whole folder to wp-content/plugins, activate it from the WP Dashboard and you'll be able to see a new option on the menu (BLO Settings). There, you can configure the database connection to wherever the _contacts_ tabe is.

Output for contact_tests.php is also printed in this page, so no need to run it manually.
